```{r}
#load package and data from package
library(fields)
data(CO2)
```

Note that CO2 is a list of 2 items; the first is lon.lat which contains 2 columns of the longitude and latitude data, the second column is the observations at the lon/lat pair.

```{r}
# Plot of all the observations 
quilt.plot(CO2$lon.lat, CO2$y) # the first input to quilt.plot needs to be a matrix of lon/lat pairs

#Add outline of world map
world(add = TRUE)
```
To find out which country a specific latitude/longitude is associated with we use the maps package
```{r}
library(maps)
lat = 40
lon = 50
country <- map.where(database="world", x=lat, y=lon)
```
