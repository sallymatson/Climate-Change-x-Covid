# Climate Change and Covid-19
Through the American Institute of Math's Climate Research Network (AIM CRN) we participated in a summer school on modeling & the covid-19 epidemic. We researched the impact of the epidemic on NO2 emissions (often used as a proxy for CO2 due to their short lifetime in the atmosphere and daily availability.)

## Data
We used daily NO2 data from OMI/Aura, accessed through GIS-DISC.
